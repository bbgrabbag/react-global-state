# React Globetrotter

## Lightweight React State Management Library

Author **Ben Turner**

`npm i globetrotter`

### ยง Description
*React Globetrotter* is designed for easily managing large or complex nested states where using several different `Context` components becomes unwieldy. 

It works by aggregating all the states and methods of arbitrarily many React components into a single `Context.Provider` component and outputs a single `Context.Consumer` component which is easily accessed via a built-in HOC function called `connect`.
